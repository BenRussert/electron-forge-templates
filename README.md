## electron-forge examples

This repo helps you to get started with many of the popular web frameworks in Electron, by providing a ready-to-go template based on [electron-forge](github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge/).

## How do I try these out?

All of the repos have the same build scripts. `cd` into the directory you're interested in, and type this to get started:

```sh
npm install -g electron-forge

```sh
electron-forge make
